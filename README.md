## History

marIntegraal stands for compleet accounting around Minimumindeling Algemeen Rekeningstelsel (Dutch Belgium).

- It is a project first commercialized end of 1985 for Amstrad/Schneider PCW on CP/M PLUS. My program written in Mallard BASIC, one of the few fast BASIC versions using B-Plus tree index sorting on CP/M and MS-DOS/PC-DOS.
- For our program that will become later on Open-Source, the commercialized version is available at our website vsoft.be (All our cliënts since 1985 can enjoy the development from then to now and ask questions. As always data of our clients remains safe using the 'Mario' program everytime switching to the lastest development platforms
- From 2025 we service our cliënts 100% delivering programs 'as a service'. More info will follow.
